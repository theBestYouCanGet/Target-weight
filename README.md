# Interplanetary Space Boxer

**Project Description**  
This program, `space.c`, is designed to help an interplanetary space boxer track his weight across different planets. As the boxer aims to win championship belts for various weight categories on planets within the solar system, this tool will assist in calculating his weight on the desired planet.

## How It Works
The program performs the following steps:
1. Asks the user to enter their weight on Earth.
2. Prompts the user to select a planet by entering a corresponding number.
3. Calculates and displays the user's weight on the selected planet based on gravitational differences.

## Usage
1. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    gcc space.c -o space
    ```
2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./space
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your Earth weight and select a planet.

## Planet Codes
Each planet is represented by a number in the program:
- 1 - Mercury
- 2 - Venus
- 3 - Mars
- 4 - Jupiter
- 5 - Saturn
- 6 - Uranus
- 7 - Neptune
